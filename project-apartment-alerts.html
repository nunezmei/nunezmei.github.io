                                    people moving here every week. As a result, rents rose 57% in King 
                                    county in the past 6 years which led to more need for affordable 
                                    housing.This very fact started &amp inspired the client in the conception 
                                    of Apartment A!erts.</p>

                        <p>Apartment Alerts is an online tool that is all about matching affordable housing and qualifying tenants. 
                           It is going to have an SMS based system where prospective tenants can register online their interest in a 
                           building or buildings, along with essential information, primarily income.Then when a unit becomes 
                           available, everyone who has registered and qualifies gets a text. Less work for the building managers, a 
                           slightly more sane process for the applicants.

                        <p>For this volunteer project, I worked on a design and tech team of eleven and helped in interviewing users,
                           research and a little bit of interaction design.This was part of the Seattle Social Good Series 
                           action-based interdisciplinary project organized by IxDA Seattle and Open Seattle. The event aimed at 
                           producing actionable solutions to support the needs of local community organizations.</p>

                            in affordable homes, ages varying from 40's- 80's. I asked about 30 questions related to
                            demographic, housing ecosystem, etc..The goal of the interview was to learn about them 
                            and their experiences in finding subsidized housing.

                        and typography choices. Green was the primary color of choice.It is the real power color. Study shows that we associate the color green with happiness, 
                        comfort, hope, excitement, and a sense of peace. And is it any wonder? Symbolically, green embodies the rite 
                        of spring when everything is flourishing and new. Just like how we wanted Sofia to feel going through the 
                        process feeling happy &amp refreshed instead of being more stressed.</p>

                        <li>This project was the very first user experience process I conducted before 
                            I started the immersive program at GA.</li> 
                        <li>Since this was a design & tech team collaboration, I learned that attitude 
                            was everything and contributing value to team meetings was essential.</li>
                        <li>For someone who was “antitech” before and just got introduced to Sketch, Invision
                            and other digital tools during the project duration, it was an intimidating 
                            yet humbling experience to take in, learn and reflect.</li>
                        <li>I appreciated more the importance of research in helping to place people at 
                            the center of the design process and Apartment A!erts as a product.</li>
                        <li>My contribution to this project was not much but this holds very dear to my 
                            heart because I’m all for affordable housing and other innovative projects 
                            that support the needs of the community.</li>

                        Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think
                        it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told “make
                        it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                        looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

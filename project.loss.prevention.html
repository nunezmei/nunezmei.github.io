                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <div class="opacity-box">
                        <p>MOOOV is an online service that lets you watch movies online and purchase tickets
                            to theaters, concerts and other events in over 90+ cities in USA. MOOOV
                            are awesome because they have a user-friendly website and app on iOS and
                            Android. They sell tickets without commission in 400+ theaters. They have
                            plenty of payment options to suit almost any user. They are fantastic and
                            friendly with their customer service, always.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <div class="opacity-box">
                        <p>In August, 2011, MOOOV launched their iOS App and since then, they’ve gone from
                            strength to strength in the online tickets market. Unfortunately, since the app’s
                            launch, it hasn’t seen the love or attention it deserves. </p>

                    <div class="opacity-box">
                        <p>So, at the end of 2015, I helped MOOOV redesign their iOS app. Acting as their Lead UI
                            Designer, we created new mobile guidelines and most of the features you’ll
                            see to this day. </p>

                        <p>User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through
                            observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies.
                            For me user research is “the process of understanding the impact
                            of design on an audience”.</p>

                        <p>Due to MOOOV’s rapid growth, there was plenty of data available to us, so we used this
                            to accurately define their user base, the way these users behaved
                            and several possible use cases for the app.</p>

                        <p>User testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate
                            a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability
                            practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system.
                            So we decided to use this technique in our app with this tasks:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Log in or Sign up;</li>
                            <li>Discover movies & TV shows;</li>
                            <li>Add something to watchlist;</li>
                            <li>Buy or book a movie ticket;</li>
                            <li>Find a specific show via search.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="opacity-box">
                        <p>One major change in the app, was to focus on personalisation. Our aim was to
                            improve user engagement by understanding more about a user’s personal
                            preferences, allowing us to predict and tailor relevant movies & TV
                            shows to each individual user.</p>
                        <p>We also needed to create a simpler, easier and more structured way to showcase movies
                            & TV shows to users. By grouping them into categories and adding promotional features
                            within the app, we created a simple and clear hierarchy users could learn and follow.</p>
                        <p>Redesigning search allowed us to create a smarter way for users to remember what they’ve
                            previously searched for and to gather suggestions for relevant, popular
                            movies & TV shows.</p>
                        <p>Creating virtual tickets was one of the most interesting features and experiences
                            within the app. Ultimately, they’re designed to save users time and
                            frustration. With virtual tickets, we removed the need for more
                            traditional means and created an experience became more reliable
                            and user friendly than paper tickets.</p>

                    <div class="opacity-box">
                        <p>In the results we created a mobile application that is able to perform the business
                            tasks. UI testing gave us an idea of how to properly organize the structure of the
                            application, providing the most positive user experience for MOOOV's users.
                            We understood the errors of the previous version of the application, which
                            was focused only on the visual part.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think
                        it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told “make
                        it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                        looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <div class="outer-box">
                        <p>For this project I was tasked to design an online shopping experience for a local business.
                           The design should meet the goals of the persona I’ve chosen, the business, and the brand. I 
                           selected Sixth World Massage Therapy which is the professional practice of J.A., a Seattle 
                           based licensed massage practitioner. I specifically chose this website because of the 
                           business’ proximity to where I live. Also, the current website needs an update. Even though 
                           the business has a substantial amount of customers affirming the great quality of massage 
                           services it provides, it does not reflect the brand it is presenting in a meaningful way.
                           Considering all these issues helped in the redesign plan.

                                <div class="imgbox">

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>Currently, the Sixth World Massage Therapy website needs an “updating”. It does not have 
                           great functionality for finding &amp; booking massage services &amp; products. It needs love 
                           &amp; attention it deserves. Also, as a one-man small business it’s trying its best to 
                           keep the company afloat.</p>            
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                        <p>By simplifying &amp; updating the website through providing great functionality for 
                           finding &amp; booking massage services, customers will have a pleasant experience in 
                           using the site and will keep on coming back. Sixth World can also increase their e-commerce 
                           revenue and entice new clients needing its services &amp; products.</p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
                  <div class="margin-box">
                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <p>I did a competitor research to help understand better how these businesses 
                               operated in terms of day to day operation &amp; website handling. I identified 3 
                               competitors (2 direct &amp; 1 popular brand for a variation).
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I compared these 4 businesses according to Key Industry Success Factors &amp; the 
                               results helped me come up with ideas on how to better Sixth World Massage's 
                               website for customer/user ease of use. Its #6 Moz Domain Authority for instance 
                               must meant something. Domain Authority (DA) is a search engine ranking score developed
                               by Moz that predicts how well a website will rank on search engine result pages 
                               (SERPS). A Domain Authority score ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores
                               corresponding to a greater ability to rank.

                            <p>I interviewed users ages ranging from upper 30’s, upper 40’s &amp; early 60’s, 3 
                               in person &amp; 1 over the phone to gain a sense of their online &amp; physical 
                               experience in terms of deciding to select a place to have a massage, scheduling 
                               an appointment, purchasing massage related products, &amp; overall customer

                                        Massage’s website?</li>
                                    <li>Where in the site do you expect to see the summary of massage service or 
                                        product you selected?</li>
                                    <li>What do you think of having photos beside each listed product’s brief

                            <p>I also asked each user to pick 2 websites from the competitor list &amp; to imagine 
                               that they were wanting to book a massage appointment, rescheduling it, &amp; paying 
                               for the service after. I reminded them to speak out any issues while going through 
                               the steps to finish the task. This led to the discovery of any pain points within 
                               the massage type selection, appointment scheduling, &amp; checkout process.</p>

                          <p>How do I help solve this problem? I started by picking a persona that will represent 
                             my target user, which would contextualize specific issues &amp; help me come up with 3 
                             user scenarios. Paper sketching possible scenarios, analyzing the current site map, 
                             &amp; making the user flows were next. Testing &amp; iterating my designs followed, which 
                             then helped me in designing low fidelity wireframes in Sketch.

                    <p>The storyboard started with Daniella wanting to get a massage. She likes to pamper herself 
                       once in awhile after all her busy schedule &amp; holiday shopping she’s done lately. A friend 
                       from church recommends this great massage place near her work. Daniella goes online &amp; 
                       searches for the place. She checks the services &amp; fees and tries to schedule an 
                       appointment. Immediately, she’s brought to another website to continue the scheduling. After 
                       she picks the kind of massage &amp; session she prefers, she’s being asked for her email 
                       address. She’s overwhelmed with all the steps she has to go through before she can even 
                       book an appointment. She’s also wary of putting her personal info in that scheduling website. 
                       She closes her pc &amp; makes a call. No one answers the phone.

                      that in mind, I designed a solution that would allow her to have a great experience as she goes 
                      through the website to look, book, &amp; pay for massage service as painless as possible.</p>
                <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                    <p>I made a simple revision of the current sitemap &amp; came up with this:</p>
                    <div class="img-box">
                        {% include img.html one=true
                            image="media/projects/sixth.world.sitemap" %}
                    </div> 
                <h3>User flow</h3> 
                    <p>I developed a potential user flow Daniella might take through. Here it describes the experience she 
                       makes in deciding how to navigate through the site. The flow starts when Daniella is wanting a 
                       massage. She searches online to look for massage parlor nearby. She then looks up for Sixth World 
                       Massage Therapy website per a friend’s recommendation. Next flow focuses on the product/massage
                       types discovery. It is followed by her booking for an appointment &amp; lastly contacting the 
                       business to reschedule the appointment. I realized the flow feels incomplete without including a 
                       simple guest checkout process.Guest checkout is one of the most liked features per user interviews
                       I did. The current site does not allow that at all. 
                    </p>

                  <h3>Card Sorting</h3> 
                     <p>A card sorting was done with a few potential users which led to the creation of their mental model 
                        &amp; helped with information architecture. While observing the users in their approach to arranging 
                        and designating, this paved the way in the recreation of the site’s navigation &amp; sitemap.</p>
                         <br>
                     <p>I wanted to highlight the site organization in general while focusing on the e-commerce solutions 
                        as well. The intention was to help improve some of the issues users mentioned with the present 
                        website.

                                       experience that Sixth World Massage Therapy could embrace.

                                               button was way too far to the bottom right of the product detail page. These were

                                               worldwide. This number is even higher in emerging eCommerce markets. As for button, 
                                               tiny mistakes can cost business dearly- in fact one poorly  designed button might

                                            <p>One of the users I tested mentioned that reading through the Homepage especially was 
                                               a little hard to read because the texts were too small. Going back to my persona, 
                                               this would not go well with Daniella. I adjusted it to readable size. Making this 
                                               adjustments was also understanding my target audience, the message I was trying to 
                                               communicate, and what I wanted them to do amongst other things. Font size impacts 
                                               both accessibility and usability.

                                            <p>Designing the Booking Confirmation page to make it personalized and customized was 
                                               one thing. Reading and understanding the message was another. One of the test 
                                               participants commented that reading through the booking confirmation page might 
                                               not be a good experience because of the dark fill color I’ve chosen. Contrast fail.
                                               Sticking  to white and calm colors always stood out. It is worthy to note that even 
                                               though this was a minor change, color is an important form of communication. It can 
                                               sway thinking, change actions, and cause reactions.

                                            <p>The importance of the URL in the pop-up screen was questioned by one of my users. It 
                                               was also mentioned that the message prompt was unfriendly and too demanding. I made 
                                               some updating by removing the URL  and rephrased the message to a more empathetic 
                                               way by adding “Please”.

                <h2>Action Plan &amp; Reflections</h2>
                      <div class="outer-box">
                          <p>Doing this project was a humbling learning experience for me. Every step of the UX process is equally 
                              important to the others.Without a solid UX design process, a designer could be completely moving in 
                              the dark. A clear and concise UX process, on the other hand, makes it possible to craft amazing 
                              experiences for users.Here are some of the takeaways:
                          </p>
                          <br>
                           <ul>
                                <li>User research plays an important role in User experience. It helps in thoroughly understanding 
                                    the users, assessing how well a designer is serving their needs, and uncovering opportunities 
                                    to create something even better. If given a chance to test more users to learn more about their 
                                    motivations and preference in using Sixth World Massage Therapy’s website, I’ll gladly do it.</li>
                                <li>SKETCHING is to die for. Even Leonardo Da Vinci had to sketch out his inventions before he 
                                    started to build them. It is easy to come up with any design idea, but the challenging part is 
                                    understanding how that idea will take shape in user experience design. Rapid prototyping 
                                    specifically paper prototyping was helpful. Several tweaking were done with the sketched out 
                                    paper prototype as it was easy to make changes. From that point on, I was able to spend more 
                                    time digitizing my frames using InVision which was also neat and more efficient as I was going 
                                    through that stage.</li>
                                <li>Lastly, my action plans include testing more users and improving the visual aspect for the rest 
                                    of the screens. I would also want to link the unexplored screens to the ones I made. I’ll spend 
                                    time structuring content of the remaining pages/screens.</li>

                    <blockquote>
                        Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think
                        it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told “make
                        it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                        looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

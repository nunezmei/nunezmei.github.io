                            <p>Apartment Alerts is an online tool that is all about matching affordable housing and qualifying tenants. 
                            It is going to have an SMS based system where prospective tenants can register online their interest in a 
                            building or buildings, along with essential information, primarily income.Then when a unit becomes 
                            available, everyone who has registered and qualifies gets a text. Less work for the building managers, a 
                            slightly more sane process for the applicants.

                        <h3>Market Research</h3>
                        <p>Learning about the Qualification for Low Income Housing was a critical part of the process. In order 
                           to come up and ask the appropriate questions, I had to understand the basics of Affordable Housing.</p>
                           <br>
                        <p>Affordable Housing is a type of housing which is deemed affordable to those with a median household income
                           as rated by the national or local government by a recognized housing affordability index. A commonly 
                           accepted guideline for housing affordability in the US is a housing cost that does not exceed 30% of a 
                           household's gross income.Seattle Housing Authority for instance, prioritizes in serving applicants to be on
                           the waitlist for Low-Income Public Housing if they earn 30% or less of Area Median Income (AMI) or who are 
                           homeless but households earning 80% or less of AMI are eligible to apply.</p> 
                        <br>
                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                        <p>I prepared a competitive research spreadsheet to enhance my undertanding of the industry. I found that
                           most housing and tenant matching online tools are great in their own way but can vary in terms of 
                           reliability of services, ease of use, and presence of simple to advanced features.

                            With regards to interviewing, I was able to interview 4 tenants who are currently living 
                            in affordable homes, ages varying from 40's- 80's. I asked about 30 questions related to
                            demographic, housing ecosystem, etc..The goal of the interview was to learn about them 
                            and their experiences in finding subsidized housing.

                            <p>Sofia is a single mother of 2. Her rent has increased. She can no longer afford it. 
                                Her lease will be up in 5 months, and she needs to find an affordable home for her and her 
                                2 children quickly.She learns about Apartment A!erts from her case worker or ad somewhere, 
                                and may be through a friend. She signs up to receive Apartment text alerts to phone. She 
                                then answers preapplication questions. She gets notified of next steps if there is one. 
                                She'll also get notification if she's not approved for subsidized housing and other 
                                alternative options she can do. Otherwise, she'll get another alert when there's an opening. 
                                Later on, she is able to begin her application process thanks to Apartment A!erts.

                    <p> Alison and Emily the lead interaction and visual designers helped create the moodboard, UI elements, color, 
                        and typography choices. Green was the primary color of choice.It is the real power color. Study shows that we associate the color green with happiness, 
                        comfort, hope, excitement, and a sense of peace. And is it any wonder? Symbolically, green embodies the rite 
                        of spring when everything is flourishing and new. Just like how we wanted Sofia to feel going through the 
                        process feeling happy &amp; refreshed instead of being more stressed.</p>

                            I started the immersive program at GA.</li> 
                        <li>Since this was a design &amp; tech team collaboration, I learned that attitude 
                            was everything and contributing value to team meetings was essential.</li>
                        <li>For someone who was “antitech” before and just got introduced to Sketch, Invision
                            and other digital tools during the project duration, it was an intimidating 
                            yet humbling experience to take in, learn and reflect.</li>
                        <li>I appreciated more the importance of research in helping to place people at 
                            the center of the design process and Apartment A!erts as a product.</li>
                        <li>My contribution to this project was not much but this holds very dear to my 
                            heart because I’m all for affordable housing and other innovative projects 
                            that support the needs of the community.</li>

                        it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                        looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

            <p>My name is Mary Ann Denman. I am a UX designer based in Seattle, Washington.</p>

            <p>I have always had a servants heart. It makes me happy to be able to do something 
               for someone that they can’t do for themselves. Taking care of family when they’re 
               sick, helping friends in need, being protective of my siblings, whatever it was. I 
               like to be there and provide for the people that I care about. Nursing allowed me 
               a career where I actually got personal enjoyment from what I did. My family and 
               friends even joke about what a people pleaser I am and that I can be self -  
               sacrificial at times. Almost always true but it’s what I loved to do until UX came.</p>
               
            <p>Why shift to UX? Why not? Combining UX Design and my nursing background into a career 
               is a great mix of elevating my desire to help people even more. My previous experience 
               as a healthcare professional is of an advantage in creating usable and accessible 
               solutions that are absolutely necessary to making user-centered experiences.

            <p>As a User Experience Designer with a background in nursing and project management, 
                I solve problems through my application of empathy. I design user-centered 
                experiences that are engaging and accessible to provide an inclusive environment 
                that achieves the required business goals while still allowing people to have 
                dignity and feel respected. Personally, I enjoy volunteering and participating in 
                innovative projects that support the needs of local community.

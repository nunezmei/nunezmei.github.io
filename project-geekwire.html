                    <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>GeekWire is a fast-growing, national technology news site founded in 2011 with 
                           strong roots in the Seattle region and a large audience of loyal, tech-savvy 
                           readers around the globe, who follow the site for breaking news, expert 
                           analysis and unique insights into the tech industry. Though it sees a high 
                           usage rate on mobile, it tends to focus on the native web experience versus the 
                           app. The mobile app puts their collective effort in the palm of your hand 
                           giving you access to all the latest news stories right on your iPhone. Right 
                           now, the company would like to understand  the current usability problems and 
                           obtain recommendation for improvement.</p>
                            
                        <p>For this concept piece, I worked on a team of three and served as the <em class="cbold">User Researcher</em> 
                           and <em class="cbold">Usability Evaluator</em>.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Duration</h3>
                        <p>This project was completed over a <em class="cbold">2-week</em> design sprint.</p>
                    <h3>Process</h3>

                    </div>
                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>GeekWire mobile app users want to be able to Search an article easily without getting lost 
                            in the process. They also want to be able to Share, Bookmark, and Comment on an article within 
                            the app.</p>
                                
                        <p>Currently:</p>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The app does not have an easy search option.</li>  
                                <li>It does have share feature.</li> 
                                <li>It lacks bookmarking capability.</li>
                                <li>It does not have commenting ability within the app.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="imgbox">

                                {% include img.html
                                    image="media/projects/geekwire.sharing"

                                {% include img.html
                                image="media/projects/geekwire.nobookmark"

                    <h3>The Solution</h3> 
                        <p>By adding features that make GeekWire mobile app have a clean look and to keep usability simple and easy, 
                           users will have a great experience in using the app. Showcasing more of what the website has to offer 
                           into the app will keep user returns up and bring in more business.</p>

                <div class="margin-box margin-p">
                    <h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
                    <div class="outer-box"></div>
                    <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>The first three days were spent gathering initial data to better understand the current app 
                           and user needs. As a team, we formulated 10 generic questions to be used for interviews 
                           among users of technology news mobile app. Being the team researcher, I went out and 
                           conducted three in-person interviews.</p>
                        <br>   
                        <p>I also got in touch with one of the founders of GeekWire through email exchanges. I asked 
                           him about the history of the company, the branding, logo, and his stand on the  current state 
                           of the native web and mobile experience.</p>
                        <br>   
                        <p>On the other hand, I inquired participants about their experience in using other mobile app 
                           for tech news and Geekwire mobile app as well. During the in-person interviews, I also 
                           questioned participants about their observations, pain points and wishes for GeekWire mobile 
                           app. I took extensive notes throughout the in-person interviews. Together as a group, we 
                           synthesized the responses through card sorting. Based on the analysis, we identified 4 
                           primary insights within the current app:</p>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Geekwire mobile  app does not have easy search capability. </li> 
                                <li>It does have share feature.</li>
                                <li>Bookmarking is non-existent.</li>
                                <li>Commenting within the app is unavailable.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="imgbox">

                        <br>
                        <p>I also spearheaded the sending of Screener Surveys using Survey Monkey. In the survey were 10 
                           questions related to demographic, experience habit, behavior, and participation questions. We 
                           had a total of 30 respondents, 14 males, 16 females from Asia, Australia, and North America, 
                           ages varying from 20’s to 70’s.

                        <p>These three apps are one of the biggest when it comes to accessing 
                        latest technology news stories, and each has their strengths and weaknesses 
                        in terms of how they operate. Which one provides more relevant content? 
                        Which one has the biggest reach? Which one is more engaging to the users ? 
                        It’s imperative to evaluate and consider some important specs of GeekWire, 
                        TechCrunch, and Appy Geek when it comes to designing the mobile app.</p>

                   <h3>Persona</h3>
                        <p>The team and I developed a proto persona based on my initial user research. His name is 
                           Zach Peterson, a very busy full stack developer at Amazon. Being a tech entrepreneur, 
                           he networks with a lot of potential investors and with future employers. He is always 
                           hungry for information about latest tech trends. He wants to be successful with the app 
                           he’s developing. As a regular tech news mobile app reader, he gets frustrated when an 
                           app lacks depth, has difficult navigation, no comment ability within the app, lacks 
                           search field and no sharing features. He likes to share news with family and friends. 
                           Unable to do some of those things ruins his day.

                    <p>Based on the results of user research, I helped in selecting the top three pain points to address in 
                       our redesign:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide search field </li>
                            <li>Allow sharing option</li>
                            <li>Add bookmark feature</li>
                        </ul>    
                    <h3>Sketching &amp; Design Studio</h3>
                        <p>Todd being the Interaction Designer led the creation of some rough sketches for the 
                           featured screens. I also provided my input as we did rounds of whiteboarding.

                        <p>A major feature my group mates and I tried to figure out was the bookmark screens. To 
                           generate ideas quickly as a team, we held a design studio. We brainstormed how 
                           bookmarking should be done, displayed and it became a major component of our redesign.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My sketches are on the top left. Within 5 minutes, we made as many possible solutions 
                           we could think of, then discussed and provided feedback on the reason we did a 
                           specific screen design.

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                        <p>Todd finished up the low fidelity wires. As soon as he was done, he exported the paper 
                           prototype into Pop so I could immediately test the designs with users.  I did the 
                           testing in person and remotely as well. I brought in results from testing and relayed 
                           my documentation to Todd and Mackie. Todd incorporated the changes and started 
                           designing high fidelity wires.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                        <p>After sitemap was revised by Mackie, user flow and initial wires finalized by Todd, I 
                           started thinking about usability testing. When I was doing usability testing, I used 
                           three “almost based on a true story” scenarios I came up with taking into consideration 
                           our proto persona’s needs. I realized an additional scenario was also possible without 
                           disturbing the original task scenarios. I suggested to incorporate “commenting on an 
                           article” since we thought about this important feature from before.

                        <p>Todd completed the wireframes as I went ahead with testing the designs with users. As I brought in 
                           results from testing, Todd incorporated changes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I went ahead and continued with another round of usability testing this time with the “commenting an 
                           article” included. I received a lot of great feedbacks about the Search, Share, and Bookmark features. 
                           A few minor issues of the screens had to be iterated. One was related to the ability to comment an 
                           article. Originally, we made that feature wherein when a user posts a comment on an article, in order 
                           for that post to be seen in social media as well, it would ask the user to login first in whatever 
                           social network his/her account is connected to. We realized that some users might prefer posting their 
                           comments anonymously within the app. So, we made the necessary changes.

                        <li>For future steps, I would like to spend time finessing the visual design. Due to time constraints, we 
                            were not able to get in a final round of user testing with the mockups.</li>
                        <li>I also got good feedback from teammates on my research skills, which reinforced my understanding of my 
                            curiosity, systematic, and commitment skills.</li>
                        <li>As a team, we also thought about elevating the overall branding of GeekWire to beat competitors through 
                            adding podcast and videos in app, language support and push notification to address the non-English 
                            speaking followers of the app. Most importantly, integrating GeekSummit App since 40% of GeekWire 
                            income is generated through organizing events.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, the key finding was that our users (and with consideration to the proto persona) need to have a 
                            great mobile app experience when it comes to reading and accessing latest technology news stories. We 
                            created a redesign of the mobile application in an attempt to solve the current pain points of the users 
                            by adding search, bookmark, commenting within the app features,  and retaining the share capability, but 
                            more testing is needed to find out if this is truly an effective solution for our users.</li>

                                Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think
                                it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told “make
                                it look good”. That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it
                                looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
